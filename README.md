The purpose of this webpage is to easily create a printable template for Arizona Odometer Statements.
The user needs to input the Customer Name, VIN, Employee name, and the date. 
Then a printable page that is correctly formatted to print on an Impact Printer (Epson LX350). 
This website will validate the vin by running it through a VIN decoder (https://vpic.nhtsa.dot.gov/decoder/).
Additionally it will output the year, make, and bodystyle that is needed for the odometer.
